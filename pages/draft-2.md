## Farming Critters technique

### 1) Things you need to know

- 1\.1: Usually only 1 to 3 event critters appear on the entire map. 
- 1\.2: Whenever you enter a battle the critters are reset. 


### 2) Things that must be avoided

- 2\.1: Spotting a critter and engaging in battle before catching it. 
- 2\.2: Not manually saving the game after catching a critter 


### 3) MVP's technique

Go to Fall Grove and go down to the place indicated on the map, your objective is to eliminate all the enemies along the path indicated in red, but you will do it using the following method:

Whenever you enter a fight, go back to the beginning to look for critters that possibly appeared after the fight.

I like to use the Bombardment Gadget to eliminate 5-6 enemies early on and then use my recruits to clear the indicated path, **always looking for event critters**.

If you find one, **take it, battle someone and continue the path** until you finish it.

After finishing the path indicated in red, this is when your adventure/struggle will truly begin.

**Go all the way around picking up the critters you see, fight a battle and go all the way back.**

**Repeat** the method until you run out of energy.

If you have a strong team, you can improve this path, also incorporating the path in blue or yellow, the path in purple can be done without having to fight anyone, since it is easy to escape from enemies when walking along it.<br>

💪 👊

## Farming Items technique 1

### 1) Things you need to know

- 1\.1: There are usually only 3 items per map, so if you get all 3, you don't have to look for more.
- 1\.2: You can leave and enter the map to make new items appear.
- 1\.3: The star marks where items can usually appear. (there are places outside this marking, but the route described does not cover these places)


### 2) Things that must be avoided

- 2\.1: Not manually saving the game after catching an item


### 3) MVP's technique

It's a very simple event, start at the marked location and follow the path in white, **paying attention to the locations marked with a star**.

The white path can be done without having to enter battle using the Invisibility Gadget, Shockwave Generator Gadget and some skill. An easy way is to keep clicking on the Gadgets to "pause" the game and choose the best path.

After completing it, the red part can be done using your recruits in battles.

Returning to the white part of the beach where it is easy to avoid fights by running away from enemies.<br>

**Remembering that if at any stage you find 3 items, you can leave the map, because you will hardly find more.**<br>

💪 👊

## Farming Items technique 2

### 1) Things you need to know

- 1\.1: There are usually only 3 items per map, so if you get all 3, you don't have to look for more.
- 1\.2: You can leave and enter the map to make new items appear.
- 1\.3: The star marks where items can usually appear. (there are places outside this marking, but the route described does not cover these places)
- 1\.4: If you call your recruits on a map, they may not follow you when switching maps.


### 2) Things that must be avoided

- 2\.1: Not manually saving the game after catching an item


### 3) MVP's technique

This is one of the simplest methods. Basically you'll be switching maps and looking at the marked locations. You probably won't find 3 items on each map, as there are several other places where they can appear, but this way you won't have to fight if you're good at dodging enemies.

Another advantage is that you can pick up more than 10-15 items per race, which saves a lot of canisters if you don't have the mayor's pass.

**As soon as you look as much as you can from the indicated places, change the map and look again.**

Whenever you change maps, items will appear in new locations and enemies will change, perhaps giving way to areas you couldn't reach without fighting.<br>

💪 👊
