# Danger Zones


<div markdown="1" class=" ghcms ghcms-intro">

**Danger Zones are special zones that require Danger Zone Fuel ![inline block](</assets/img/icons/icon-dangerzonefuel.png>) to visit. Danger Zones are home to much tougher enemies and bosses as well as better rewards in the form of Danger Chests. The further from the landing spot a chest or enemy is, typically the higher level/tier it will be. Danger Zones are no laughing matter! They're hostile, and Danger Fuel is scarce and precious. Be sure make the most out of every trip!**

### Overview

**Danger Zone Fuel ![inline block](</assets/img/icons/icon-dangerzonefuel.png>):** Similar to **Repair Canisters ![inline block](</assets/img/icons/icon-energycanister.png>)**, Danger Zone Fuel is used travel to a selected Danger Zone from the World Map. Each trip to a Danger Zone will cost a single Danger Zone Fuel. Fuel replenishes every 20h up to [Boat Level 14](</boat#level-14>) and replenishes **3x faster** at [Boat Level 15](</boat#level-15>) (in practice every 8h).

    **Player (Option A):** I sure am<br>

    **Player (Option B):** What are you doing in the Danger Zone?

- **Bexley:** Are you searching for the Danger Zone treasure too?<br>

    **Player (Option A):** Yes<br>

    **Player (Option B):** No, just looking for some ice bot parts<br>

    **Player (Option C):** I already found the treasure

- **Bexley (upon picking A):** Well I must warn you: I am certain to reach the treasure first. So you might as well give up now!<br>

    **Player (Option A):** You're right, I'll turn around and go home.<br>

    **Player (Option B):** You won't beat me sitting around catching your breath all day.<br>

    **Bexley (upon picking B):** How dare you! I'll show you who's the bravest botmaster! *(Fight)*

- **Bexley (upon picking B):** A wise choice! A pipsqueak like you wouldn't stand a chance against the bots guarding the treasure anyway.<br>

    **Player (Option B):** Pipsqueak?! We'll see about that. *(Fight)*

    **Player (Option A):** Nope, I found the treasure while you were bravely resting here.<br>

    **Player (Option B):** You're right, maybe it was just some loose scrap someone dropped.<br>

    **Bexley (upon picking A):** How dare you! I'll show you who's the bravest botmaster! *(Fight)*<br>

    **Bexley (upon picking B):** Of course. You wouldn't know the real treasure if you found it. Which you won't, because you're not strong and brilliant like me. *(ends encounter)*



*(upon ending encounter)*

- **Bexley:** Ta ta!

- **Ember:** Obviously fire abilities are better! You can set the whole battlefield on fire.

- **Flake:** But you can stop any bot on its tracks with an ice ability. It's like scissors, paper, rock. Ice beats fire.

    **Player (Option A):** I can beat any ice abilities in battle. *(battle with Flake)*<br>

    **Player (Option B):** I can beat any fire abilities in battle. *(battle with Ember)*<br>

- **Mad Scientist:** Hello there botmaster! I have modified my Chaos Translocator to work on organic matter instead of bots.

- **Mad Scientist:** Would you like to help me test it?<br>

    **Player (Option A):** What does your machine do exactly?<br>

    **Player (Option B):** Not in a million years *(ends encounter)*

- **Mad Scientist:** It can teleport a willing subject to a random location in this zone.

- **Mad Scientist:** I've already tested it on unwilling subjects, but now I want to test it on someone who says yes first. What do you say?<br>

    **Player (Option A):** Heck yes! *(teleports player to random location in DZ)*<br>

    **Player (Option B):** That sounds kinda dangerous...<br>

    **Player (Option C):** No way! *(ends encounter)*

- **Mad Scientist:** It's perfectly safe! Depending on where you end up teleporting to. And assuming all your internal organs teleport there too. So, ready to test it?<br>

    **Player (Option A):** Yes! *(teleports player to random location in DZ)*<br>

    **Player (Option B):** Maybe another time *(ends encounter)*



*(upon teleporting)*

- **Mad Scientist:** Bon voyage, test subject!


### **Tourist Hostage**

![300px bandittourist](</assets/img/dzs/npc_tourist.png>)<br>

A bandit has taken a tourist hostage! You have the choice to pay a ransom or fight to release him, or not. When released, he will give you a large amount of coins and scrap. THIS IS ALWAYS WORTH DOING, AS THE TOURIST WILL GIVE YOU BACK MORE COINS THAN YOU PAY.

### Loadout

- 6 random bots selected specific to the area<br>

- 4 random abilities



### Interactions

- **Bandit:** Oi botmaster. I just kidnapped this guy. Do you wanna pay his ransom?<br>

    **Player (Option A):** Maybe, who is he<br>

    **Player (Option B):** Not really *(ends encounter)*



*(upon ending encounter)*<br>

**Bandit:** Eh, it was worth a shot.<br>

**Tourist:** Excuse me, do you know where tourist information is?

- **Bandit:** Some tourist. Said his travel agent booked him on an adventure holiday to the Danger Zone.

- **Tourist:** Are you my porter? I have a lot of luggage for you to carry.<br>

    **Player (Option A):** I'm here to rescue you!<br>

    **Player (Option B):** What's the ransom?<br>

    **Player (Option C):** No thanks, I'm a bit busy *(ends encounter)*



*(upon ending encounter)*<br>

**Tourist:** This place smells of sulfur and I have allergies.

- **Bandit (upon picking A):** Hey, hands off, we kidnapped him first! Finders keepers.<br>

    **Player (Option A):** I'm not going to kidnap him, I'm going to save him! *(Fight)*<br>

    **Player (Option B):** Fair enough. What's the ransom?

- **Bandit (upon picking B in both above scenarios):** Sigh. There's nobody else around to rescue him, so we'll say ![inline block](</assets/img/icons/icon-coin.png>) 20\. What do you reckon?<br>

    **Player (Option A):** Okay *(Pay ![inline block](</assets/img/icons/icon-coin.png>) 20)*<br>

    **Player (Option B):** I'm not paying any ransom! *(Fight)*<br>

    **Player (Option C):** That's outrageous! I'll take him for ![inline block](</assets/img/icons/icon-coin.png>) 10<br>

    **Player (Option D):** Nah you can keep him *(ends encounter)*



*(upon ending encounter)*<br>

**Bandit:** Eh, it was worth a shot.<br>

**Tourist:** What an adventure! Waiter, can I order a martini while we're waiting for someone to ransom me?<br>

**Bandit:** I already told you, I'm not a waiter! Urgh.

- **Tourist:** Hey, I'm worth more than ![inline block](</assets/img/icons/icon-coin.png>) 10! You're rude.

- **Bandit:** Urgh fine, ![inline block](</assets/img/icons/icon-coin.png>) 10 just to get him off my hands.<br>

    **Player (Option A):** Deal *(Pay ![inline block](</assets/img/icons/icon-coin.png>) 10)*<br>

    **Player (Option B):** On second thoughts, you can keep him *(ends encounter)*



*(upon ending encounter)*<br>

**Tourist:** Excuse me, do you know where tourist information is?

- **Bandit (upon picking A):** Thanks! This kidnapping went way better than I expected. See ya round.

- **Tourist:** Thanks for helping with my bags. You can keep this one, it's full of scrap and weighs a ton. Don't know why I packed it haha!

- **Tourist:** The room service is terrible here. If I survive the journey home, I'll be leaving a 3-star review at most.

*(With enough coins)*
