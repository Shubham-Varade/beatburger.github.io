## Thank you Featherweight
A big thanks to the devs for their support to our project and this event!

Also it needs to be perfectly clear that this event, like this wiki, is self-organized by community members, and not by FW itself. Any complains (and praise? :P) should be addressed accordingly.

## Important
The goal and purpose of this event is to **introduce more of you to the wiki's internal workings**, have you explore its content a bit more, and walk you through the first steps of **contributing to it**.

### It's a group project
We can only give so many rewards, but you musn't see this as a competition. Or only so much as it may motivate you to write an even more awesome guide than your neighbor. We want to welcome and reward new contributors, and making valuable edits is only part of it. For the event to be a success you will all need to be able to coordinate with each other, collaborate maybe, share tips and help each other definitely.

### You don't need to know how to code!
We've been careful from the start of the project to make it as accessible as possible, to everyone. Regardless of their tech know-how, or hardware. 
Everything that's expected from you in this event can be done with a mobile, even though it's of course often more comfortable from a laptop or desktop.

### You will still have to read and learn some stuff
We wrote tutorials, documentation, etc, to offer every bit of information you should need to do your first steps in the project. 
You will have to read it though.
We will do our best to have people as available as possible to answer any question, and help you through any hiccup. Any help you need, ask about it in the #wiki-contributions thread :)

### This is a volunteer project, with its flaws and limitations
We're very proud of our wiki, but it is still a little side-project built on goodwill and free time. Depending on the reception of this event, we may find out that it struggles to bear the load of too much activity.
We're in this together, and whatever difficulties we encounter, we'll find ways to work around it! Once again, group project, and collaboration.
The same is true to the organization of the wikiweek event itself: if our small team is too solicited, we'll have to rely on other participants to help and guide newcomers.

### Trust, but verify
You will be granted access to change and edit the wiki directly. We expect everyone to act responsibly and be the most considerate of every party involved: the wiki itself, others contributions, featherweight...
We (wiki staff) won't tolerate any abuse of the access we're sharing, and reserve the right to update the rules accordingly without notice, as well as removing individuals from the event. Up to cancelling the WikiWeek altogether.

Note: this only applies to purposedly harmful behavior. Good-faith mistakes can totally happen, and you musn't be afraid to make some, that's kinda part of the learning process. You will have guidelines to follow to reduce the risk to a minimum, but if you did an oopsie, just let us know as soon as possible and so we can restore it shortly ;)

## Rewards

### Community appreciation
- Top 10 contributors: 50 gems

### Wiki Staff picks
- Most impressive content: 50 gems (for long pieces, guides, etc)
- Most helpful hand: 50 gems (for helping others who may struggle with technical stuff)
- Most prolific editor: 50 gems (for making the thousand little edits and fixes everywhere)


## Rules

- Contributions need to be applied to the wiki before the end of the event. Suggestions and ideas are cool too, but this event is about making tangible progress right now.
- Editor Mode credentials will be supplied to you so you can edit text directly.
- Wiki Staff members will do their best to help you every step of the way!
- You will be given access to spreadsheets with all the bots infos, abilities etc., so you can update them and ask for your changes to be applied.
- Any change you want to do but can't see how, we'll do our best to help. If it can't be done during the event, aim smaller for now, and we can pick up your project after :)
- The #wikiweek thread will provide you with all the documentation you need, and is where you will post and edit your contributions. #wiki-contributions is available to discuss anything and help each other out.
- At the end of the event, everyone will be reminded to react on the submissions again so we can have the top 10. Rewards will follow shortly.
- Just because there are rewards doesn't mean it's a competition! The goal is to get everyone familiarized with the wiki editing process, so we can all enjoy having the best wiki possible. Counter-productive behaviors won't be kindly looked upon.

## Documentation

[General wiki doc for reference](https://github.com/beatburger/beatburger.github.io/blob/main/README.md)

### How WikiWeek works
- Read the doc below
- Find yourself a good first contribution to do. Don't pressure yourself into being too ambitious for your first steps!
- DM it to Pix and get the credentials you need to make it happen
- Re-read the doc below
- Seriously, do it
- Let's go, try and edit it yourself!
- Join #wiki-contribution to help each other out, discuss the experience, provide feedback on others contributions...
- Create your submission post in #wikiweek and describe/link your contribution from there. Only 1 post per contributor, edit it later if you make other contributions.
- Rejoice & Repeat
- When the event ends, come back to #wikiweek to vote on the contributions you appreciate most!

### How to prepare a valuable contribution
- find an area to improve
- scroll over questions or tips-and-tricks for good stuff worth integrating (ask permission+give credits!)
- use discord search to dig up game data:
    - use 'in: channel', 'from: user', 'has: file' to better your search results. Example: use 'in: community-guides firefly' for check for messages containing 'firefly' in 'community-guides' but especially 'wiki-assets' where many have shared great stuff that hasn't made it into the wiki yet! 
- write it out in your favorite text editor, so it's already saved on your device just in case.
- check the formatting syntax to add bold, italics, make titles, lists, links, or images in your text

### How to use Editor Mode to edit content
![Editor Mode usage demo](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/1077764570dde697200709de12c5b7790666d4d4f3cf58a9a7b27b506da381fc/68747470733a2f2f63646e2e646973636f72646170702e636f6d2f6174746163686d656e74732f3931373830393739303238343037393131342f3937393430383931393737383639373232362f656469746f722d6d6f64652e706e67)

- get your credentials (DM pix)
- login from the [admin login page](/admin)
- take a first tour, click a couple "Edit" buttons, try changing some stuff to preview the result, but don't save anything just yet.
- **safety talk: read the section** below to ensure your hard work can't be lost due to someone else's mistake or a potential internal bug. 
- have at it
- add this contribution to your #wikiweek submission!

Note: chat with others in the thread so you don't realize mid-way that someone else just did what you had in mind and started already...

**Safety talk: local backup so no risk of losing anything**
- Some issues *may* arise when multiple persons are using editor mode at the same time. 
- (roughly: your own editor loads the current version of the page, someone else updates it separately, you edit and publish your version: theirs is lost). 
- Only under specific circumstances and we've never suffered from it ever so far, but this week comes with new challenges, and maybe a couple surprises... So help us keeping your hard work absolutely safe.
- tldr: Save your work (for your sake), and Refresh Before commit (for others sake)

**Step-by-step**
- Write your new content on a separate text editor
- Try it on the Editor Mode to proofread/see how it looks
- Refresh the page to make sure you're looking at the most recent version of the wiki
- copy/backup your content again
- Save (commit)
- (opt) check the history, see if your edit was registered (instant)
- (opt) check the content got updated (may have to wait 10s-3min and refresh the page)
- (opt) archive your local backup in we ever need you to find it again 
*Sorry that's a bit messy but that's what we get when building software fast and suddenly wanting to make a big event out of it...*

### How to use the WikiSheet to update Bots, Botpack modules, Materials, etc...
WikiSheets are google sheets that we use to document everything there is to know about everything listed above. 

Here's what they look like, sorry that's how it is for now... Don't get scared, what you don't understand is what's optional, and before anything there goes into the wiki we will review and complete as necessary.
- [Bots](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m5DJ7U41LqJgtbf2jezs6u3LvuOlTLH4iwik5-VtSd0/edit#gid=0)
- [Abilities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n7BTSFQbv6tJnssi4PZz1PXjbFA8bebbw99CFSkf5kk/edit#gid=0)
- [Boosters](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LnejD6GO7dZ_Wmt-d55QWcOeGEGUIqIu-zp2E8mH97M/edit#gid=0)
- [Bots mats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ngGZbxF6W7fa5H6aa2dNFQsX9RrLWDITyLaKs35ecBQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Boat mats](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12eKq1OxHjfLERbBPOmjjN3yLjKbRcXmChsho00IrJeU/edit#gid=0)

(demo copies you can't edit yet, to illustrate. Still open for comments but we won't be checking, so if you put interesting stuff there tell us about it on discord)

Just identify the cells you understand what they're doing, and if you see missing/wrong info, you've probably got a contribution worth doing already!

- identify what contribution you want to do (from the wiki itself, the demo copies won't be updated constantly during the week)
- identify where the data should go in the relevant wikisheet
- ask for access to the actual wikiweek wikisheet (dm @pix, tell me about your plans too)
- access the live version
- do your changes
- remove the "synced" so wiki staff knows it's been updated and the wiki still hasn't
- add yourself to the credits cell, update the date
- takes notes as a backup (you can download the entire sheet even) just in case
- let a maintainer know you updated the sheet and it's ready for review/update
- as soon as we can, we'll make it live!
- add this contribution to your #wikiweek submission!
