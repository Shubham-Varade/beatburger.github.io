# Nebula's Comp

- [Virus](</virus>), [Chainer](</chainer>), [Beat](</beat>), [Pluggie](</pluggie>), [Mort](</mort>), [Fork](</fork>)
- 2 [Ult Cooldowns](</ult-cooldowns-rare>), [Faerie's Blessing](</faeries-blessing>), [Sub-Zero](</sub-zero>)
- [Hypercharge](</hypercharge>), [SCT](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>), [Vanish](</vanish>), [Team Translocator](</team-translocator>)


## Tips

### Deployment

- [Pluggie](</pluggie>) \+ [Beat](</beat>) first, ensure [pluggie](</pluggie>) is within [beat](</beat>)'s inspire range. After enemy deploys 2nd bot, deploy [chainer](</chainer>), such that [chainer](</chainer>) is able to grab as many enemies as possible. 
- [Chainer](</Chainer>) (with the above boosters) will only be able to grab phantom when it is placed first, however, because you are placing him 3rd so you can anticipate the rest of the bots, be prepared that phantom is going to [vanish](</vanish>) before [chainer](</chainer>) can pull him. 
- Any bot placed on top of [inkjet](</inkjet>) during deployment will prevent his instant fade. Useful trick so that [chainer](</chainer>) can pull [inkjet](</inkjet>) off the get go. Things get rough when [inkjet](</inkjet>)'s squad shadow activates. 
- Ensure that when you deploy [chainer](</chainer>), it is not too far away from [pluggie](</pluggie>) \+ [beat](</beat>). 
- If an enemy bot is hiding (e.g. [inkjet](</inkjet>) or [bullseye](</bullseye>)) and is too far away from the rest of the bots, don't try to stretch [chainer](</chainer>)'s range, such that it is too far away from [pluggie](</pluggie>) \+ [beat](</beat>). 


**Special case**: If enemy has a [nozzle](</nozzle>), place [chainer](</chainer>) as far away from [beat](</beat>) and [pluggie](</pluggie>) such that [nozzle](</nozzle>) can only stun 2 out of 3 bots. You can't escape from [nozzle](</nozzle>)'s drop stun. Best you can do is not let [chainer](</chainer>) get stunned as well.

### Attack

- For most of the time, you want to spam [hypercharge](</hypercharge>) on [chainer](</chainer>). 
- [Beat](</beat>)'s inspire will increase [pluggie](</pluggie>)'s damage drastically and will melt the enemies. 
- [Beat](</beat>)'s stun is 3.25s. [Chainer](</Chainer>)'s stun is 2s. Try to ensure that both stuns follow one after another and not overlap. You want maximum value from your [hypercharge](</hypercharge>) on [chainer](</chainer>). 


The moment [chainer](</chainer>)/[pluggie](</pluggie>) falls, if [beat](</beat>) is still standing, deploy [fork](</fork>) within [beat](</beat>)'s inspire range. Now your target for [hypercharge](</hypercharge>) switches to [beat](</beat>). (he has almost double stun length as compared to [chainer](</chainer>)).

If [chainer](</chainer>), [pluggie](</pluggie>), [beat](</beat>) falls, priority goes to hypercharging [fork](</fork>), especially when [virus](</virus>) is targeting another bot besides [bigshot](</bigshot>)/[bullseye](</bullseye>).

- [Fork](</Fork>) will interrupt [bullseye](</bullseye>)/[bigshot](</bigshot>)/[shuffle](</shuffle>) ults at the key moment and also increase his survivability. This can also spread and even the poison damage amongst all enemy bots, giving you greater value. 
- [Virus](</virus>) is particularly effective when deployed on high damage snipers like enemy [bullseye](</bullseye>). 
- [Mort](</mort>) is a late game bot, use [SCT](</supercharged-chaos-translocator>) to deal 17-18k damage, enough to wipe out most non-tanks. 


Enemy phantom/nibbles with nectar of the gods/any form of stun resist is particularly deadly to [chainer](</chainer>). Beware beware! Since both these bots are very fragile, ensure that you give rush to kill them.

Using [Vanish](</vanish>) on [pluggie](</pluggie>) makes his next 2 attacks very high damage (coupled with [beat](</beat>)'s inspire this can ramp up to incredible amounts of damage with 2 zaps). This is how i rush to kill high damage enemy bots in seconds.

### Facing specific scenarios

**[Deep Freeze](</deep-Freeze>) At high level arena (6500+):** enemies will usually [deep freeze](</deep-freeze>) either [beat](</beat>)/[pluggie](</pluggie>), so don't panic, follow the routine of hypercharging [chainer](</chainer>). Most of the time, opponent will run out of energy for [deep freeze](</deep-freeze>), and you will get the upperhand in that stalemate.

**[Hack missile](</hack-missile>):** Perhaps the most deadly ability against this comp. Always always monitor the opponent's energy. Ensure that you use [hypercharge](</hypercharge>) wisely for [chainer](</chainer>), such that it doesn't overlap with [beat](</beat>)'s stun. Only [hypercharge](</hypercharge>) when you need to. Save up 4 energy for [team translocator](</team-translocator>). The moment the opponent's energy hits 6, he will fire, so have your thumb on TT, and get ready to teleport away (either to a hiding enemy bot, vulnerable at close range, or to a safe space).

**Hiding bots:** Use Team translocator to get directly on them. This comp is designed for close range massive damage. The hiding bot will melt in no time. ðŸ™‚ Hiding bots to beware of: [Comet](</comet>), [bullseye](</bullseye>), [bigshot](</bigshot>).
