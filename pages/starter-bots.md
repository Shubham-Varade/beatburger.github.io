## Choosing the right bot

**Luckily, regardless of which bot you choose as your starter, you will eventually unlock the other two. However, choosing the right starting bot can help you clear through the early story missions and build a solid team comp.**

## Ram

**Charges head-first into battle and knocks its enemies all over the arena. High mobility and high damage.**

[Chaser](</bots#chaser>) \- Chasers are fast melee bots that are good at getting close to ranged enemies.

Ram is overpowered, but sometimes disrupts your own strategies. Ram can easily throw enemy brawler to your sniper, so be careful.

Be careful when using Ram in [Chainer](</chainer>) combos as it will heavily disrupt it's synergy with other bots.

## Froggy

**A ranged bot with a slowing slime attack, powerful legs to leap away from enemies, and a devastating poison attack ultimate.**

[Evader](</bots#evader>) \- Evaders are fast bots that are good at staying away from melee enemies.

Has low hp, but can easily destroy a bunch of enemies with his ability. Slowing effect is also useful.

## Thump

**A tough bot that leaps into the fray to protects its teammates.**

[Tank](</bots#tanks>) \- Tanks soak up damage and protect weaker bots.

Don't underestimate Thump! In the right comp his stunning abilities are a great choice against [Snipers](</bots#snipers>) and [Evaders](</bots#evaders>).
