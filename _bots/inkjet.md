### 'Evader Build' by Wolfhaize
- **BBCBA** Makes Inkjet very difficult to catch up to.

### 'Damage Build' by Wolfhaize: 
- **BACAA** Inkjet provides more damage and weakens enemies more.

### 'Hybrid Build' by Wolfhaize(Recommended) 
- **BBCAA** The best of both worlds.

## Comments:

### Evaluation by Echio
Synergyzes really well with [Bigshot](/bigshot) for Recruit Setups, since it'll guarantee that it will be vanished before each shot as long as InkJet stays alive. It can also work as a [Chainer](/chainer) combo disruptor and is really good for non-Chainer setups, specially ones that rely on [Chasers](/chasers) or slow [Brawlers](/brawlers)
