###  'Evader Build' by Hex

- **BABCA:** Recommended placing early or last (Doesn't really matter cause this bot is a survivor). Can change the tide of battle.

### 'Full Damage Build' by Hex
- **BBBCB:** It can deal more damage to a cluster of bots. Can change the tide of battle.

## Comments

### Evaluation by O.J.
*Scorpion of Great Desert, waiting for its next victim to step into the territory.*

Dune Bug is the fastest yet squishiest bot that ever existed in the game. However, both of its rolling abilities provide very high surviving capability, along with decent damaging output. Furthermore, Dune Bug has potential to fight and carry against multiple bots at the same time if managed well.

### Evaluation by Soft
A niche pick that has some secret fans trying to make him work, Dune Bug has respectable damage and can be extremely annoying to take down. He's a high-damage kiter and does the job really well. Pair him with an ultimate cooldown booster or two, set up the rest of your annoying arena team and wait until people to start pinging you on Discord to take him off your team. Tier B+.

### Story Quest
Following the main story line in the Great Desert will have you go and search for the Dune Bug botframe.
