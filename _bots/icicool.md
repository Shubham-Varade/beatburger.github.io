## 'Evader Build' by Hex 
- **BACAB:** Dodge and Shoot

### 'Sniper Build' by Hex
- **AACBB:** Think of it as a Longshot but it slows every shot it hits, a sniper that slows down enemy from afar. Also slow icicle speed

### 'Hybrid Build' by Hex
- **ABCAA:** A mix build.

## Comments

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
Ranged slowness isn't a very desirable effect in a battle, unless when the entire setup has been built around that. Due to low damage, wide spread and the low stun chance on its ultimate, Icicool ends up being of little help to the rest of the team. 

### Tips
Icicool enables some very unorthodox but effective tactics. When in a team with Rocketeer(knockback), Bouncer(slowness), they can completely lockdown slow melee bots and many that have no way to close distance.
