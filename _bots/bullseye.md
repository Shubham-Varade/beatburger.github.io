### 'Full Damage Build' by Wolfhaize(Recommended)
- **AACAA:** Will kill anything really quickly if left uninterrupted.

### 'Surival Build' by Wolfhaize
- **BBCBB:** Prioritises Bullseye's safety over his damage dealing capability.

## Comments

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
In exchange for the crazy amount of damage he does, Bullseye has terrible accuracy despite his name. He will miss quite a few shots, so it is recommended you group bots together so any arrows that fall aside still hit something. His Corrupt ability makes him extremely dangerous, applying up to 60% vulnerability to his targets and making them much easier to kill. 


### Tips
Bullseye needs a lot of space. Due to having a minimum range of 5, he will run away from enemies that visually seem to be nowhere near him, at times running straight through other enemies and getting killed in the process. Deploy him far away, and keep enemies as far away as possible.
