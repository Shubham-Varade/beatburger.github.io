### 'Event Horizon (Rapid Ultimate Build)' by TsengFayt
- **BACAA:** Build focused on rapidly repeating Comet's ultimate Lightspeed while stunning bots along the way. Pairs well with Ultimate cooldown and/or Stun duration boosters.

## Comments
To unlock the legendary botframe for Comet, you must collect 50 Star Fragments and 10 Cosmic Cores, then turn them in to Copurrnicus (located in southwest Fall Grove - Southern Slopes near the entrance to Fall Grove). Star Fragments can be obtained in the following ways:
- Arena Rewards, defeating QuarterBuck(last arena master), and as a guild event reward(Faerie Hunt).
- Found as detected scrap in heroic Danger Zones or randomly in normal zones (very low drop rate)

Once 50 Star Fragments are collected, talk to Copurrnicus (optional), and they will request 10 Cosmic Cores, which are obtained from defeating any Mega bot (100% drop rate) located in Botworld.

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
With one of the fastest charging ults in the game, Comet functions more like a splasher than anything else. HE will constantly boost his own damage while lowering nearby enemy damage with Siphon, which makes him a bot that needs to be dealt with quickly otherwise he becomes a real issue.
