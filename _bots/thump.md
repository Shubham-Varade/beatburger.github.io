### 'Tank Build' by Wolfhaize(Recommended)
- **BBCBB:** Prioritises the options that increase Thump's survivability a lot more.

### 'Attack Build' by Wolfhaize
- **AACAA:** Thump does more damage and is more aggresiive, casting his ult a lot quicker and over a larger area.


## Comments

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
With a ton of hp, speed, stun, and a leap that closes distance, Thump comes out as one of the most offensive tanks in the game. With an aoe stun, he will give any type of bots a hard time, while still being able to shrug off any of the shots fired at him. A solid tank option, and a good pick for recruits.
