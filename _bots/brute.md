### 'Full Damage Build' by Wolfhaize(Recommended)
- **BBCBA:** Upon drop he spins, stuns and if he crits will 1 hit lower hp bots. 


## Comments

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
With basically no speed, zero survivability, Brute is all about hitting enemies as hard as he can. AI-5B is a must pick that allows him to drop with his spin ready. However his ultimate makes him extremely vulerable to all damage despite giving him a massive boost. Shield him with Halo or the Shield ability, stun bots around him, or have a tank take the damage for him during this stage, and he will reward you massively.


### Tips
Wonderful for clearing grouped bots(with the spin)
Do not under any circumstances leave Brute against ranged bots, especially evaders, without any help. He is too slow to catch up, and tends to activate his spin a fraction of a second too early thus missing.
