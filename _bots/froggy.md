## Comments

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
An evader that does splash poison damage is nothing to be ignored. Due to the special capabilities of poison(bypassing shields, ignoring resistance), this bot becomes a lot more relevant when coming up against arena teams that stack resistance boosters. 

### Tips
- Couple with Chainer to make sure alot of enemies are caught in the poison pool.
- Hornet's ult(stunning all currently poisoned enemies), works well with Froggy and the two are a great teamup with a tank while dealing with wild bots. 
- Note, Froggy's basic attack is not poison. Only the ultimate is.
