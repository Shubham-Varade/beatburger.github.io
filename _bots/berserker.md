## Comments

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
Berserker is what you'd get if you tried to mix a tank with a chaser. Decent hp, stun, but also a charge that closes down distance against fleeing enemies. Although its this same lack of leaning into one role that makes him struggle to be as good as any chaser or tank. Not quite enough survivability for a tank, and not enough damage for a chaser either. 

### Tips
A fast, tanky bot recommended for shutting down ranged enemies if you don't have a chaser.
