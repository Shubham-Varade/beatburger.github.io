### 'Full Damage Build' by Hex(Recommended)
- **BAACB:** Medium range sniper, can cause crits and have high damage. Full Damage Build.

### 'Sniper Build' by Hex
- **AABCB:** Long range Sniper with moderate damage. If it finishes an enemy, it recharges railgun by 35%.

### 'Close range Build' by Hex
- **BBACA:** Short range with high defense sniper. A mix of Options 1 and 2.

## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
While there are other snipers that have better DPS than Longshot on paper, they are far more easily countered than Longshot. Longshot has very consistent damage and a failsafe ability to buy itself some time when enemies get close. A very safe pick that can easily find a great spot in any team composition.

### Tips
A must use in the early game.
