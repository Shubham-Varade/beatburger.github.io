## Comments
To unlock the legendary botframe for Nova, you must collect 50 Star Fragments and 10 Cosmic Cores, then turn them in to Copurrnicus (located in southwest Fall Grove - Southern Slopes near the entrance to Fall Grove). Star Fragments can be obtained in the following ways:
- Arena Rewards, Raid rewards, defeating QuarterBuck(last arena master), All Star League (unlocked after defeating all arena masters) and as a guild event reward (Faerie Hunt).
- Found in place of chests in heroic Danger Zones (dangerzone selection screen will show the type of chests) or randomly in normal zones (very low drop rate)

Once 50 Star Fragments are collected, talk to Copurrnicus (optional), and they will request 10 Cosmic Cores, which are obtained from defeating any Mega bot (100% drop rate) located in Botworld.
