### 'Full Tank Build' by Hex
- **BBCBB:** Strongest Defense is the best offense. Bullwark have a shield that can reflect damage and damage reduction by 30%.

### 'Attack Tank Build' by Hex
- **ABCAA:** You can run but you can't hide from an attack tank, it protects and attacks at the same time.


## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
Highly competitive with [Chainer](/Chainer) and [Nozzle](/Nozzle), Bullwark is the most traditional tank out of the three. His movement speed is alright and he has a front-facing shield that reduces damage. It soaks a lot of damage, and more often than not he's facing the bot that's fighting him, but his shield gets deactivated when stunned. A classic tank and spanker. 

### Tips
Put Bullwark in the front. Weakness is his rear since his shield is in the front.
AI-5B is recommended so Bullwark stuns enemies on drop. Can be very useful against grouped up enemies or incapacitating a problematic bot instantly.
