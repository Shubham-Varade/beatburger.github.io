### 'Knockback Build' by Gold
- **ACABA:** Pure knockback build. Good for interrupting bigshot.

### 'Troll Build' by Hex
- **BCAAA:** Build for complete annoyance.

### 'Damage Build' by Wolfhaize
- **BCBBB:** Focuses on getting the most out of Rocketeer damage wise.

## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
Rocketeer fills the niche of countering some specific bots with constant knockback CC. [Bigshots](/bigshot) charging gets interrupted by it, [Pupils](/pupil) ramping, those are just examples. He deals respectable damage too and is the only common bot that has three abilities. An absolute fantastic early game bot.


### Tips
Rocketeer enables some very unorthodox but effective tactics. When in a team with Icicool and Bouncer, they can completely lockdown slow melee bots and many that have no way to close distance.
