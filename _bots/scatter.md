### Full Damage Build
- **BACBA:** by Hex. Slow and steady Scatter also very dangerous at close range. Use gust to direct enemy to scatter.
- **BACBB:** by Diamond. Heavy-duty Scatter.

### 'StunShot Build' by Hex
- **ABCBB:** Build for Stun. Great for stunning a cluster of bots.

### 'Hybrid Build' by Hex
- **AACBX:**  You can decide for yourself at Ai5, if you want scatter to have high health or low mvspeed but high damage.


## Comments

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
Another Brawler like Brute and Nibbles that needs hrlp bringing enemies close by in order to deal full damage. Having the longest stun in the game(AI-2B required) can make him a very frustrating bot to fight against. Whereas his shots spread, it also means they travel across the entire field and will hit bots that should have no business getting hit. 

### Tips
- Couple with Halo shielding and Gust to bring enemies closer.
