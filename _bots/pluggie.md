### 'Survival Build' by Wolfhaize
- **BCBBB:** Gives Pluggie several more surival options and safeguards.

### 'Attack Build' by Wolfhaize
- **ACAAA:** Pluggie foregoes survivability to deal more damage.

### 'Hybrid Build 1' by Wolfhaize(Recommended)
- **ACBBA:** Pluggie does good damage but also survives better.



## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
Unlike other Splashers, Pluggie doesn't have splash damage, but rather damage that bounces with a max range of 4 between 4 enemies. This almost always guarantees hitting at least two, if not three bots with extremely good damage ontop of that, and he also has a baseline bouncing stun with big damage that drains ultimate charge.
