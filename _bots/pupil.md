### 'Damage Build' by Wolfhaize (Recommended)
- **AACAA:** Focuses on getting the most out of Pupil damage wise.

### 'Utility Build' by Wolfhaize 
- **BACAB:** Pupil does a lot less damage but any bots caught in his beam are very vulnerable to damage from other sources.

## Comments

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
Due to the capability of doing damage to multiple enemies, Pupil can be a good stand in for when you are not using a splasher but need a lot of enemies affected at once. His tracking is awful, soenemies that move relatively quickly will easily escape his attacks. However due to the nature of it, Pupil also unintentionally ignores stealth and will keep firing till his attack ends even if enemies are invisible, which can ghelp to deal with pesky bots like Phantom or Inkjet. 

### Tips
- Use with Chainer.
