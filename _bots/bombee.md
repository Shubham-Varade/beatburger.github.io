### 'Bombee Tank' by Hex
- **BABCB:** Ai1 and Ai3 are Health.

### 'Speed Bombee' by Hex
- **BAACB:** Drop and pray it picks a glass bot, with its speed boost it can follow a target or pushes a target and self destructs on a distance.

### 'Melee Bombee' by Hex
- **ABACA:** A different option for bombee but still explodes in the end. 

## Comments

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
Considering Bombee's ultimate always ends in his death, this is a difficult bot to recommend because it drains too much of your canister. However it becomes more viable in the arena or if you really want the damage it provides over managing your canister.

### Tips
Try to have multiple enemies around Bombee, just so you know you're getting the most out of its death. 
Chainer is recommended for its grouping and stunning capabilities.
