## Comments

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
Sheller gets to be one of the highest damage dealers in the game, in exchange for everything coming down to randomness. Sheller will randomly chuck mines all over the battlefield and also knockback any enemies that try to approach him. This makes him a really difficult bot for melee enemies to deal with, hampering movement, disrupting positioning and dealing massive damage in the process.  

### Tips
Use Gust/Gale to constantly push enemies into any mines Sheller has dropped.
