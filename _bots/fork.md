### Evaluation by Soft
Fork fills a niche role where he is currently the best poison-based attacker in Botworld. Good damage, great evasiveness and a fantastic ultimate. Poison also bypasses shields and ignores resistance, but he has trouble finishing bots off before moving onto a different target, allowing his previous target the chance to survive. With a fast charging ult, Fork can however become a very difficult bot to deal with due to the constant teleports and targeting of faraway enemies with an added dodge chance boost to himself and allies.
