### Chaser Build by Hex

- **ABCAB:** For chasing support, snipers and splashers. Ai1=slows, Ai2=speed up, Ai4=Stuns and Ai5=Crit.

### 'Damage Build' by Wolfhaize
- **BACBB** Focuses heavily on damage.

### 'Chaser Build' by Wolfhaize(Recommended)
- **ABCAB** Allows Slash to be a much better Chaser with the ability to shutdown most ranged bots.

### 'Surival Build' by Wolfhaize
- **AACAA** Focuses giving Slash some safety options in form f stuns, slowness, hp and dodge chance.



## Comments

### Evaluation by Wolfhaize
Highest DPS in the game but with no distance closing ability, he easily gets replaced by any other Chaser. A bot that can do its job at the start of the game(with AI ) but quickly falls out of favour as you progress further. 

### Tips
Can do incredible damage if assisted by other bots or with stunning abilities.
