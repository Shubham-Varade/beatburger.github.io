### 'Full Support Build' by Hex
- **AAACA:** Wide range Inspire.

### 'Fast Support' by Hex
- **BAACA:** Not so Support Build. Beat a fast support. 

### 'Brawler Beat' by Hex
- **BBBCB:** Beat was a Brawler before it became a Support, now you know.

## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
On paper, Beat sounds great but is held back by the fact that abilities are used automatically, disallowing proper setup and timing with other bots' abilities. The reason why he's placed so high is because he has a niche use for quick burst teams like groupers where every bot uses their burst at the start of the match. Very effective for farming wild bots for example. Tier A-.

### Tips
Beat can be combo to anyone
Most recomended combo is Chainer, Beat and Mort/Pluggie
