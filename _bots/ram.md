## Comments

### Evaluation by Soft
With the HP of a tank, the damage of a brawler and the speed of a chaser, Ram simply belongs in this tier because of his absurdly good stats. He has a place in any team that he's put in and does his job like no other bot can. His Horn Flick can be tricky to get used to. At endgame, chasers is often intervened by a tank while he's chasing a squishy bot. This allows him to throw the tank behind him and keep going. Tier S+.

### Tips
- Don't battle a wild bot ram.
